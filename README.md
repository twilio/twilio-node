If you've instead found a bug in the library or would like new features added, go ahead and open issues or pull requests against this repo!

## Contributing

Bug fixes, docs, and enhancements welcome! If you're not familiar with the GitHub pull request/contribution process, [this is a nice tutorial](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

#### Getting Started
Fork and clone the repository. Install dependencies with:
    
    npm install

Run the existing test spec with `npm test`.
    
To run just one specific test file instead of the whole suite, provide a JavaScript regular expression that will match your spec file's name, like: 

    ./node_modules/.bin/jasmine-node spec -m .\*accounts.\*

To run live tests (such as `client.live.spec.js`) against your [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/user/account), you will need to create a local configuration file.  In the project root directory, do the following:

* `cp config.sample.js config.js`
* Edit `config.js` with your account information, a Twilio number, and your own mobile number
* Run the live tests

#### Contributing Code

In your fork, create a new feature/bug fix branch, [per the guide listed above](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/). Write a Jasmine test spec for your new feature or bug fix, and hack until it passes!  Submit a pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as possible.

#### Contributing Docs

Right now, the docs are maintained in static HTML in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.  We hope to switch to a more robust documentation system soon, but for the time being, you can make documentation changes by editing [index.html](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-node/blob/gh-pages/index.html) directly.
