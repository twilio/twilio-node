## Documentation

The documentation for the Twilio API can be found [here][apidocs].

The Node library documentation can be found [here][libdocs].

## Unreleased Features

Some Twilio features that are exposed in this library are in Beta or Developer
Preview, and are not available to most accounts. Such products are explicitly
documented as Beta/Developer Preview both in the Twilio docs and console, as well
as through in-line code documentation here in the library.

## Versions

`twilio-node` uses a modified version of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) for all changes. [See this document](VERSIONS.md) for details.

This library works with node versions 6, 8 and above.

TypeScript is supported for TypeScript version 2.9 and above.

## Sample Usage

Check out these [code examples](examples) in JavaScript and TypeScript to get up and running quickly.

### Environment Variables

`twilio-node` supports credential storage in environment variables. If no credentials are provided when instantiating the Twilio client (e.g., `const client = require('twilio')();`), the values in following env vars will be used: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`.

If your environment requires SSL decryption, you can set the path to CA bundle in the env var `TWILIO_CA_BUNDLE`.

## Docker Image

The `Dockerfile` present in this repository and its respective `twilio/twilio-node` Docker image are currently used by Twilio for testing purposes only.

## Getting help

## Contributing

Bug fixes, docs, and library improvements are always welcome. Please refer to our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information on how you can contribute.

> ⚠️ Please be aware that a large share of the files are auto-generated by our backend tool. You are welcome to suggest changes and submit PRs illustrating the changes. However, we'll have to make the changes in the underlying tool. You can find more info about this in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're not familiar with the GitHub pull request/contribution process, [this is a nice tutorial](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

#### Getting Started

If you want to familiarize yourself with the project, you can start by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [cloning it in your local development environment](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed on your machine.

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies by running the following command in the directory of your cloned repository:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the existing tests to see if everything is okay by executing:

```bash
npm test
```

To run just one specific test file instead of the whole suite, provide a JavaScript regular expression that will match your spec file's name, like:

```bash
npm run test -- -m .\*client.\*
```
