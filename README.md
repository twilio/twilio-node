> ⚠️ Please be aware that a large share of the files are auto-generated by our backend tool. You are welcome to suggest changes and submit PRs illustrating the changes. However, we'll have to make the changes in the underlying tool. You can find more info about this in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're not familiar with the GitHub pull request/contribution process, [this is a nice tutorial](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/).

#### Getting Started
If you want to familiarize yourself with the project, you can start by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [cloning it in your local development environment](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed on your machine.

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies by running the following command in the directory of your cloned repository:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the existing tests to see if everything is okay by executing: 

```bash
npm test
```

To run just one specific test file instead of the whole suite, provide a JavaScript regular expression that will match your spec file's name, like:

```bash
npm run test -- -m .\*client.\*
```
