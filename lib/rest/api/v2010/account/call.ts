/**
 * Options to pass to create a CallInstance
 *
 * @property { string } to The phone number, SIP address, or client identifier to call.
 * @property { string } from The phone number or client identifier to use as the caller id. If using a phone number, it must be a Twilio number or a Verified [outgoing caller id](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/outgoing-caller-ids) for your account. If the &#x60;to&#x60; parameter is a phone number, &#x60;From&#x60; must also be a phone number.
 * @property { string } [method] The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;url&#x60; parameter\\\&#39;s value. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [fallbackUrl] The URL that we call using the &#x60;fallback_method&#x60; if an error occurs when requesting or executing the TwiML at &#x60;url&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [fallbackMethod] The HTTP method that we should use to request the &#x60;fallback_url&#x60;. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [statusCallback] The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If no &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; is specified, we will send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored. URLs must contain a valid hostname (underscores are not permitted).
 * @property { Array<string> } [statusCallbackEvent] The call progress events that we will send to the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;initiated&#x60;, &#x60;ringing&#x60;, &#x60;answered&#x60;, and &#x60;completed&#x60;. If no event is specified, we send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If you want to receive multiple events, specify each one in a separate &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; parameter. See the code sample for [monitoring call progress](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/call-resource?code-sample&#x3D;code-create-a-call-resource-and-specify-a-statuscallbackevent&amp;code-sdk-version&#x3D;json). If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [statusCallbackMethod] The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [sendDigits] A string of keys to dial after connecting to the number, maximum of 32 digits. Valid digits in the string include: any digit (&#x60;0&#x60;-&#x60;9&#x60;), \\\&#39;&#x60;#&#x60;\\\&#39;, \\\&#39;&#x60;*&#x60;\\\&#39; and \\\&#39;&#x60;w&#x60;\\\&#39;, to insert a half second pause. For example, if you connected to a company phone number and wanted to pause for one second, and then dial extension 1234 followed by the pound key, the value of this parameter would be &#x60;ww1234#&#x60;. Remember to URL-encode this string, since the \\\&#39;&#x60;#&#x60;\\\&#39; character has special meaning in a URL. If both &#x60;SendDigits&#x60; and &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; parameters are provided, then &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; will be ignored.
 * @property { number } [timeout] The integer number of seconds that we should allow the phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. The default is &#x60;60&#x60; seconds and the maximum is &#x60;600&#x60; seconds. For some call flows, we will add a 5-second buffer to the timeout value you provide. For this reason, a timeout value of 10 seconds could result in an actual timeout closer to 15 seconds. You can set this to a short time, such as &#x60;15&#x60; seconds, to hang up before reaching an answering machine or voicemail.
 * @property { boolean } [record] Whether to record the call. Can be &#x60;true&#x60; to record the phone call, or &#x60;false&#x60; to not. The default is &#x60;false&#x60;. The &#x60;recording_url&#x60; is sent to the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL.
 * @property { string } [recordingChannels] The number of channels in the final recording. Can be: &#x60;mono&#x60; or &#x60;dual&#x60;. The default is &#x60;mono&#x60;. &#x60;mono&#x60; records both legs of the call in a single channel of the recording file. &#x60;dual&#x60; records each leg to a separate channel of the recording file. The first channel of a dual-channel recording contains the parent call and the second channel contains the child call.
 * @property { string } [recordingStatusCallback] The URL that we call when the recording is available to be accessed.
 * @property { string } [recordingStatusCallbackMethod] The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;recording_status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;.
 * @property { string } [sipAuthUsername] The username used to authenticate the caller making a SIP call.
 * @property { string } [sipAuthPassword] The password required to authenticate the user account specified in &#x60;sip_auth_username&#x60;.
 * @property { string } [machineDetection] Whether to detect if a human, answering machine, or fax has picked up the call. Can be: &#x60;Enable&#x60; or &#x60;DetectMessageEnd&#x60;. Use &#x60;Enable&#x60; if you would like us to return &#x60;AnsweredBy&#x60; as soon as the called party is identified. Use &#x60;DetectMessageEnd&#x60;, if you would like to leave a message on an answering machine. If &#x60;send_digits&#x60; is provided, this parameter is ignored. For more information, see [Answering Machine Detection](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/answering-machine-detection).
 * @property { number } [machineDetectionTimeout] The number of seconds that we should attempt to detect an answering machine before timing out and sending a voice request with &#x60;AnsweredBy&#x60; of &#x60;unknown&#x60;. The default timeout is 30 seconds.
 * @property { Array<string> } [recordingStatusCallbackEvent] The recording status events that will trigger calls to the URL specified in &#x60;recording_status_callback&#x60;. Can be: &#x60;in-progress&#x60;, &#x60;completed&#x60; and &#x60;absent&#x60;. Defaults to &#x60;completed&#x60;. Separate  multiple values with a space.
 * @property { string } [trim] Whether to trim any leading and trailing silence from the recording. Can be: &#x60;trim-silence&#x60; or &#x60;do-not-trim&#x60; and the default is &#x60;trim-silence&#x60;.
 * @property { string } [callerId] The phone number, SIP address, or Client identifier that made this call. Phone numbers are in [E.164 format](https://wwnw.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) (e.g., +16175551212). SIP addresses are formatted as &#x60;name@company.com&#x60;.
 * @property { number } [machineDetectionSpeechThreshold] The number of milliseconds that is used as the measuring stick for the length of the speech activity, where durations lower than this value will be interpreted as a human and longer than this value as a machine. Possible Values: 1000-6000. Default: 2400.
 * @property { number } [machineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold] The number of milliseconds of silence after speech activity at which point the speech activity is considered complete. Possible Values: 500-5000. Default: 1200.
 * @property { number } [machineDetectionSilenceTimeout] The number of milliseconds of initial silence after which an &#x60;unknown&#x60; AnsweredBy result will be returned. Possible Values: 2000-10000. Default: 5000.
 * @property { string } [asyncAmd] Select whether to perform answering machine detection in the background. Default, blocks the execution of the call until Answering Machine Detection is completed. Can be: &#x60;true&#x60; or &#x60;false&#x60;.
 * @property { string } [asyncAmdStatusCallback] The URL that we should call using the &#x60;async_amd_status_callback_method&#x60; to notify customer application whether the call was answered by human, machine or fax.
 * @property { string } [asyncAmdStatusCallbackMethod] The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;async_amd_status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;.
 * @property { string } [byoc] The SID of a BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier) trunk to route this call with. Note that &#x60;byoc&#x60; is only meaningful when &#x60;to&#x60; is a phone number; it will otherwise be ignored. (Beta)
 * @property { string } [callReason] The Reason for the outgoing call. Use it to specify the purpose of the call that is presented on the called party\\\&#39;s phone. (Branded Calls Beta)
 * @property { string } [callToken] A token string needed to invoke a forwarded call. A call_token is generated when an incoming call is received on a Twilio number. Pass an incoming call\\\&#39;s call_token value to a forwarded call via the call_token parameter when creating a new call. A forwarded call should bear the same CallerID of the original incoming call.
 * @property { string } [recordingTrack] The audio track to record for the call. Can be: &#x60;inbound&#x60;, &#x60;outbound&#x60; or &#x60;both&#x60;. The default is &#x60;both&#x60;. &#x60;inbound&#x60; records the audio that is received by Twilio. &#x60;outbound&#x60; records the audio that is generated from Twilio. &#x60;both&#x60; records the audio that is received and generated by Twilio.
 * @property { number } [timeLimit] The maximum duration of the call in seconds. Constraints depend on account and configuration.
 * @property { string } [url] The absolute URL that returns the TwiML instructions for the call. We will call this URL using the &#x60;method&#x60; when the call connects. For more information, see the [Url Parameter](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls#specify-a-url-parameter) section in [Making Calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls).
 * @property { string } [twiml] TwiML instructions for the call Twilio will use without fetching Twiml from url parameter. If both &#x60;twiml&#x60; and &#x60;url&#x60; are provided then &#x60;twiml&#x60; parameter will be ignored. Max 4000 characters.

 *
 * @property { string } [url] The absolute URL that returns the TwiML instructions for the call. We will call this URL using the &#x60;method&#x60; when the call connects. For more information, see the [Url Parameter](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls#specify-a-url-parameter) section in [Making Calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls).
 * @property { string } [method] The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;url&#x60;. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { CallUpdateStatus } [status] 
 * @property { string } [fallbackUrl] The URL that we call using the &#x60;fallback_method&#x60; if an error occurs when requesting or executing the TwiML at &#x60;url&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [fallbackMethod] The HTTP method that we should use to request the &#x60;fallback_url&#x60;. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [statusCallback] The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If no &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; is specified, we will send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored. URLs must contain a valid hostname (underscores are not permitted).
 * @property { string } [statusCallbackMethod] The HTTP method we should use when requesting the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
 * @property { string } [twiml] TwiML instructions for the call Twilio will use without fetching Twiml from url. Twiml and url parameters are mutually exclusive
 * @property { number } [timeLimit] The maximum duration of the call in seconds. Constraints depend on account and configuration.
